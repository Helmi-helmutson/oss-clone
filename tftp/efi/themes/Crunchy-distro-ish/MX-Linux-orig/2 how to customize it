### BACKGROUND IMAGE ###
if you use directly an image, it could corupt your grub menu (it'll reboot instead of showing your menu).

DO USE THE CONVERT FUNCTION TO BE SURE THAT YOUR GRUB WILL STILL BOOT

source of the image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MX-Linux/mx17-artwork/master/Default_wallpaper/mx_wall_3_night_by_hys_walls.jpg

for example, the convert command that have been used for this theme is (after a "open a teminal here" in the folder of the image):
sudo convert mx_wall_3_night_by_hys_walls.jpg -resize 1920x1080! -quality 80 /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-distro-ish/MX-Linux-orig/mx_wall_3_night_by_hys_walls.jpg

The sudo is only to have the right to write a file in the /boot folder.

### FONTS ###
the font, in grub, can be loaded only in one size per file. You can make the pf2 file with that command ("open a terminal here", in the folder where the font is):

sudo grub-mkfont -s 18 -o /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-distro-ish/DejaVu_Sans_normal.pf2 DejaVuSans.ttf -v
or
sudo grub-mkfont -s 16 -o /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-distro-ish/DejaVu_Sans_Bold_normal.pf2 DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf -v
or
sudo grub-mkfont -s 32 -o /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-distro-ish/DejaVu_Sans_title.pf2 DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf -v

-s: size
-o: output
-v: verbose (necessary to know how to call the font in theme.txt)

you can add too
-b: bold

The errors messages doesn't bother the efficiency of the resulted pf2 files.
