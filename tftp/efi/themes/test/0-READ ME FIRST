to install the themes in /boot/grub you have to use this command line:

sudo tar -zxvf Crunchy-GRUB2-themes.tar.gz -C /boot/grub



in some distribution, sudo is not active. So you have to type:

su
(passwd)
tar -zxvf Crunchy-GRUB2-themes.tar.gz -C /boot/grub


to use one of the theme, you have to edit the file /etc/default/grub with root rights with the command, for example:

sudo -i gedit /etc/default/grub

you'll had at least this line (see "1 how to install it" file for more details in each theme folder), for example:

GRUB_THEME="/boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-simple/theme-tropical.txt"


to make it active, you have to update your grub:

sudo update-grub
