### BACKGROUND IMAGE ###
if you use directly an image, it could corupt your grub menu (it'll reboot instead of showing your menu).

The source of the image is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mate-desktop/mate-backgrounds/master/desktop/Ubuntu-Mate-Warm-no-logo.png

DO USE THE CONVERT FUNCTION TO BE SURE THAT YOUR GRUB WILL STILL BOOT

for example, the convert command that have been used for this theme is (after a "open a teminal here" in the folder of the image):
sudo convert Ubuntu-Mate-Warm-no-logo.png -resize 1920x1080! -quality 80 /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-ubuntu/0_commun/Ubuntu-Mate-Warm-no-logo.jpg

The sudo is only to have the right to write a file in the /boot folder.

### FONTS ###
the font, in grub, can be loaded only in one size per file. You can make the pf2 file with that command:

sudo grub-mkfont -s 18 -o /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-ubuntu/OpenSans_normal.pf2 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Light.ttf -v
or
sudo grub-mkfont -s 32 -o /boot/grub/themes/Crunchy-ubuntu/OpenSans_title.pf2 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/Open_Sans/OpenSans-Light.ttf -v

-s: size
-o: output
-v: verbose (necessary to know how to call the font in blue-theme.txt, green-theme.txt, grey-theme.txt or orange-theme.txt)

you can too add
-b: bold

The errors messages doesn't bother the efficiency of the resulted pf2 files.
